    "## K-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "K-fold cross-validation is a popular technique for estimating a model's out-of-sample estimation error. It is similar to, but more sophisticated than, the validation set approach that we have considered in examples so far. The process for scoring a model using K-fold cross validation is detailed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start by randomly splitting the labeled data into *K* roughly-equal-sized pieces called folds.\n",
    "2. We then train *K* versions of the model, each using the same set of hyperparameters. \n",
    "3. Each version of the model is trained on *K-1* folds, validated on the remaining fold. That is to say, we calculate the out-of-sample validation score for each model using the single fold on which that particular model was not trained. Each fold is thus used as the validation set for exactly one model. \n",
    "4. This will result in *K* out-of-sample validation scores. We average these scores together, and report that as the cross-validation score for the model. \n",
    "5. We then retrain the model on the entire collection of labeled data that is available to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the cross-validation score is calculated as the average of several out-of-sample estimates, it tends to provide a more stable estimate of the model's out of sample performance than that obtained using a single validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common values for K are 3, 5, 10, and n-1. When *K = n-1*, we refer to the technique as **leave-one-out cross-validation**, or LOOCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of perforning K-Fold cross-validation is illustrated in the figure below. "
