    "A **class** is a programmer-defined data type. Python and its external packages contain many useful data types, but classes allow a programmer to create custom data types that are tailored to specific use-cases. Classes can contain functions, called **methods** as well as variables, called **attributes**. Classes are defined using the `class` keyword. \n",

The attribute `r` is intended to store the radius of the circle, while `x` and `y` store the coordinates of the circle's center point. Our class will also contain a single method, called `area`. This will return the area of the circle, rounded to two decimal places. "
