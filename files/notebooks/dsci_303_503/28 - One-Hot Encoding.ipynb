    "## Categorical Features\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is **categorical**, or **qualitative** if it takes on values from a finite set of categories or classes. Such values are often recorded as strings, but might also be encoded using numerical labels. Such numerical labels do not typically have any numerical or quantitative significance.The possible values that a categorical variable can assume are referred to as its **levels**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-Learn implementations of supervised learning models require all of the feature information to be provided in a numerical format. If we wish to use a categorical variable as a feature in a Scikit-Learn model, we can do so, but we must first find a way to numerically encode the variable. The most common technique for numerically encoding qualitative information is to use **one-hot encoding**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform one-hot encoding on a categorical variable, we must introduce new variables, referred to as **dummy variables**. The encoding will have one dummy variable for each level found within the categorical variable. The values found within a dummy variable will be either 0 or 1. A particular dummy variable is equal to one for observations with the associated level, and is zero otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume that we have a categorical variable `Z` with four levels: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. A one-hot encoding for `Z` will create four new variables: `Za`, `Zb`, `Zc`, and `Zd`. The value of these dummy variables for each possible level of `Z` is shown in the table below.\n",

    "| Z | - | Za | Zb | Zc | Zd |\n",
    "|---|---|----|----|----|----|\n",
    "| a | - | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |\n",
    "| b | - | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |\n",

    "| d | - | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n",
