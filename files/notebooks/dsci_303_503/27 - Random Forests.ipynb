    "An **ensemble** model is one that generates its predictions by combining the predictions from several simpler models. There are two voting schemes that can be using a classification ensemble. When using **hard voting**, the individual models will use their predictions for a given observation to vote for the class to be assigned to the observation by the ensemble. In a **soft-voting** scheme, the individual models will each produce an estimated probability distribution over the possible classes, and these will then be averaged across all of the models to generate the ensemble's estimate for the probability distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is often the case that the ensemble model will have better predictive performance than any of the individual models from which it is built.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **random forest** is an ensemble of many decision trees. To ensure that the trees are different from one another, each tree is trained on a different subset of the training set. Assume that our training set contains `n` observations. When building a tree model to be used in a random forest, a sample of size `n` is drawn from the training set, with replacement. This sort of sampling is referred to as **bootstrap** sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sampling is done with replacement, each sample will likely be different from every other sample, which will encourage differences in the trees making up the random forest. The random forest implementation in Scikit-Learn further encourages diversity among the trees in a forest by randomly selecting the feature on which to split at each stage in the construction of a tree in the forest. \n",
