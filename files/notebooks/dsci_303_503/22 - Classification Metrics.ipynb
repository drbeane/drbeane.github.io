    "## Classification Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the a classification model's accuracy with respect to a particular dataset is equal to the proportion of observations in the dataset for which the model generates correct predictions. Accuracy is a commonly used metric for measuring the performance of a classification model. However, it can sometimes give misleading results, especially when working with datasets in which the classes are very imbalanced. When a large majority of the observations in a dataset belong to a single class, a \"naive model\" that always predicts the majority class will get a very high accuracy score, but will be completely useless. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will introduce two new classification metrics, known as **precision** and **recall**. These metrics can be used to give us a sense as to how well a classification model performs on specific classes, rather than on the dataset as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by importing a few tools that we will need in this lesson. Take note of the functions `classification_report` and `confusion_matrix` that we import from the `sklearn.metrics` module. We will discuss these functions later in the lesson."

    "A **confusion matrix** is a table that can be used to get an idea as to how a classification model performs on individuals classes, as well as the types of mistakes that the model is prone to making. A confusion matrix is structured so that there is one row and one column for each class. The rows are associated with the actual observed values of each class, while the columns are associated with the predicted values of each class. Each cell in the table contains a number, which is the count of the number of observations that are actually in the class associated with the row the cell is in, and that were predicted to be a member of the class assocuiated with the cell's column. \n",
