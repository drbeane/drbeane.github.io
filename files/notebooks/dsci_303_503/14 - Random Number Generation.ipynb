    "The numbers generated by functions in `np.random` are not truly random. Typical computers are simply not capable of \"true\" randomness. The numbers generated by functions in `np.random` are obtained from a **pseudorandom number generator**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudorandom number generators create sequences of numbers that satisfy certain statistical properties that we would expect from \"truly random\" numbers. The sequences are algorithmically generated from a base value, which is called the **seed**. To ensure that the results are different each time, a pseudorandom number generator will typically use a source such as the computer's system clock to seed the algorithm. However, we are able to set the seed ourselves manually. This unsures that we get the same \"random\" results each time we run a code involving pseudorandom numbers. This is useful for occasions when we want to generate results that behave randomly, but are reproducible. \n",
