I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics, and the Director of the Division of Mathematics and Computer Science at Lindenwood University.

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from the Missouri University of Science and Technology (formerly known as the University of Missouri at Rolla) in 2002. After taking a year off from my academic pursuits, I later returned to Missouri S&T to pursue graduate studies, earning a Master's of Science in Mathematics in 2005 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2008. Both graduate degrees were completed under the supervision of my academic advisor, Dr. Wlodzimierz J. Charatonik.

After completing my Ph.D., I spent two years as a Lecturer in the Mathematics Department at The Pennsylvania State University. I returned to Missouri in 2010 to join the faculty at Lindenwood University as an Assistant Professor.
