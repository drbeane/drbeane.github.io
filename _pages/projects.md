This page contains information about some of the programming projects on which I have worked, along with samples of code that I have written for these projects.

## Course Development
Many of these courses I have developed in recent have involved programming. The notes I have developed for these courses provide examples of code that I have written. Some notable courses are mentioned below.

+ [Big Data Analytics](courses/dsci417/bigdata.md)

  This course covers the use of Apache Spark for performing distributed data analysis. The course emphasizes the use of PySpark to develop applications within a Databricks environment. Specific topics covered in the course include RDDs, Spark DataFrames, Spark SQL, Machine Learning, and Structured Streaming.

+ [Python for Data Science](courses/dsci303/python.md)
