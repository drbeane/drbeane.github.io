These are resources that I prepared for the courses <b>MTH 32400 - Theory of Financial Mathematics I</b> and <b>MTH 32500 - Theory of Financial Mathematics II</b>. These courses are intended to prepare students for the Society of Actuaries FM Exam. Below you will find 126 pages of lecture notes that I wrote for use in these classes, as well as a formula sheet and flash cards that I provided to the students.

<b>Lecture Notes</b>
+ [All Chapters](FM Notes.pdf)
+ [Chapter 01 - The Measurement of Interest](FM - Chapter 01.pdf)
+ [Chapter 02 - Annuities](FM - Chapter 02.pdf)
+ [Chapter 03 - Reinvestment and Amortization](FM - Chapter 03.pdf)

<b>Additional Resources</b>
+ [FM Exam Formula Sheet](/resources/actuarial_resources/FM - Formula Sheet.pdf)
+ [FM Exam Flash Cards](/resources/actuarial_resources/FM - Flash Cards.pdf)

I have also created a homework system for use in this course. The system consists of over 400 algorithmically generated multiple choice problems and is intended to provide students with a means of practicing problems similar to those that they might find on the FM exam. I will later post documents providing samples of the types of problems found in this homework system.
