These are resources that I prepared for the course <b>MTH 32600 - Models for Financial Economics</b>. This course was developed to prepare students for Society of Actuaries MFE Exam. That exam has subsequently been renamed IFM, and the course content has been altered somewhat. These resources you find here have not yet been updated to reflect this change.
