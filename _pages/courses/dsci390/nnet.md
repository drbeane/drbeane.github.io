This page contains links to html renders of Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab notebooks that I developed in Spring 2019 for the course **DSCI 39001 - Neural Networks** offered at Lindenwood University. These notes were used during the first time I taught the course, when I was less experienced with the field of deep learning. I would change many things the next time I taught the course. I would also consider moving all of the lecture material into Google Colab.

**Disclaimer:** These notebooks are not intended to be a standalone resource for machine learning. These were created to supplement lecture presentations. Many of the lessons (especially the later ones) would benefit from additional exposition.
