This page contains links to html renders of RStudio notebooks that I developed in Fall 2019 for the following two courses offered at Maryville University:
+ DSCI 412 - Predictive Modeling (Undergraduate)
+ DSCI 512 - Predictive Modeling (Graduate)

These courses intriduce the theory of several machine learning and statistical learning techniques. They also cover the use of R for performing tasks related to the techniques.
