This page contains links to html renders of Jupyter Notebooks that I developed in Spring 2019 for the course <b>DSCI 35600 - Machine Learning</b> offered at Lindenwood University.

**Disclaimer:** These notebooks are not intended to be a standalone resource for machine learning. These were created to supplement lecture presentations. Many of the lessons (especially the later ones) would benefit from additional exposition.
