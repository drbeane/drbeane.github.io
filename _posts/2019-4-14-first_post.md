Hello. My name is Robbie Beane. I am Associate Professor of Mathematics at Lindenwood University. I primarily teach courses in Data Science, Statistics, and Actuarial Science.

I created this site to have a place to share resources that I have developed for courses, as well as tutorial I have written, and projects on which I have worked.

I have added some content on the **About** and **Courses** sections of this site, but much more needs to be added. This site is very much a work in progress.
