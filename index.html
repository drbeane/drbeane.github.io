This is the homepage of Robbie Beane, Associate Professor of Mathematics and Director of the division  of Mathematics and Computer Science at Lindenwood University. This page will be used as a place to post information related to the courses I teach, resources for mathematics, statistics, data science, and actuarial science, as well as personal projects on which I have worked. This page is very new, and is still very much under construction.
